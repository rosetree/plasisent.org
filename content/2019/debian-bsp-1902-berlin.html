<p>Last weekend I joined
the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/BSP/2019/02/de/Berlin">Debian <strong>Bug
Squashing Party</strong> (<abbr title="Bug Squashing
Party">BSP</abbr>) in Berlin</a>. A BSP is a “party” for people
interessted in fixing bugs before the release of the next Debian
version. About 5–13 developers sit in a room, everyone stares at their
laptop and works on issues that others have reported days, months or
years ago. You probably have to like it – but I enjoyed it!</p>

<p>Before the BSP started, I hadn’t fixed a single bug in Debian. Also
I had no experience of the bug fixing workflow. I had read
the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/BSP/BeginnersHOWTO">BSP Beginners
HOWTO</a> in the Debian Wiki a few days earlier. That helped a little
bit. But it turned out, that most current projects use different
tools, that are not mentioned in the howto,
like <a href="https://honk.sigxcpu.org/piki/projects/git-buildpackage/">git-buildpackage</a>
and <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/UsingQuilt">quilt</a>. And as
always in software development, you’ll find an exceptional case,
behaving different than expected.</p>

<p>On the first day, I didn’t achive a lot. I got consumed by two bugs
I couldn’t fix. But it wasn’t frustrating. I met nice people, got the
know the environment and the different bug tracking sites with their
filters. That probably set up the stage for the next day. Together
with <a href="https://steinbiss.name/">Sascha Steinbiß</a> – who
organized this BSP – I selected bugs for the second day, that were
more suitable for me. Although I didn’t work on packages that are used
by many people, I’m happy, that I could at least send in some
patches.</p>

<aside><h2>Thank you!</h2><p>Thanks to Sascha, for all the help and
for organizing this event. And thanks
to <a href="https://www.dcso.de/">DCSO</a> for sponsoring lunch,
drinks and wifi during those days.</p></aside>

<p>As I said before: You probably have to like it. But for me the
concept of a BSP is part of why I love free software: I had no
experience with the workflow. After a short email exchange with
Sascha, I registered for the event and became part in a world wide
project, that got started even before I was born. That’s great and
something I’d recommend to every software developer (and student) who
uses Debian (or another distribution): Go and check
the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/BSP">upcoming BSPs</a>; there
might be one near you.</p>
