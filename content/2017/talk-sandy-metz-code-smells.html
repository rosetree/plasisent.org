<p>Some notes on the talk <cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJjHfa5yxlU" hreflang="en" title="at RailsConf 2016">Get a Whiff of This</a></cite> by <a href="https://www.sandimetz.com/" hreflang="en">Sandi Metz</a>.</p>

<p><b>Code Smells</b> are indicators to common problems. They are very specific and have names (e.g. Speculative Generality). <b>Refactorings</b> are recipes (solutions) for Code Smells. They are like a cookbook for code. Recipes use other recipes to refactor code.</p>

<p>You should not always refactor. If code does not change, you might not need to refactor&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Think of objects as players of a role not as instances of their class. Use <b>Dependency Injection</b>. Try to remove mocks/stubs from your tests.</p>

<p>I should read <a href="https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html" hreflang="en">Martin Fowlers book about Refactoring</a>.</p>

<p>She mentions a Tool to identify Code Smells (for Ruby?): Reek</p>

<p>Looking at your old code and hating it is awesome. It shows that you learned and improved in the last years.</p>
