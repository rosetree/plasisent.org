# Archive of [plasisent.org][]

This was the source code of my blog [plasisent.org][]. It used:

* The static site generator [Nanoc][].
* [kramdown][] to compile markdown.
* [SASS][] as CSS preprocessor.
* [HAML][] to create the layout.

## Markdown-Style

* Try to be as compatible as possible.
* Break Markdown at column 80, except when doing an HTML block.
